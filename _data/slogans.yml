- One Step Beyond.
- What got us here, will not get us there.
- Sometimes you just have to get on the fucking bus.
- Crossing the river by feeling the stones.
- Bias towards action.
- A public second brain for when there is fog.
- Free the web.
- Now, today, tomorrow, and always.
- It has happened again.
- And the rest is pacing.
- Spending warm summer days indoors.
- Agents of the free.
- The day's moving just too fast for me.
