It is called "weak notes" as a play on words of the popular Government "[week](https://promo.cymru/resource/weeknotes/) [notes](https://weeknot.es)" blogging style - due to the likelihood, posting will be inconsistent and irregular, and having worked adjacent to Government for 14 years.

The site is a [progressive web app](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) (PWA) and can be installed on devices from modern browsers. There is no cookies or tracking other than some of the CloudFlare protection and RUA.

At the time of checking the site has [valid HTML](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fthechels.uk%2F) and [valid CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fthechels.uk&profile=css3svg). There is minimal JavaScript used on the site purely for the [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) for caching and offline support. The site also utilises a web App Manifest for Progressive Web App (PWA) support.

![website colour scheme](/images/colour-scheme.png)

The font-family is a custom font, secondary to that the site utilises the user's operating system setting via the `-system-ui` declaration, `Gill Sans` if available, and as a last resort falls back to `sans-serif`. This means it should look natural and native to the operating system in use should the primary font not work. The primary colour scheme is `White Smoke` as the background, `Night` for text, `Brunswick Green` for links, `Lapis Lazuli` for some additional/secondary text e.g., post meta data and sub headings, and finally `Citron` is used for accents e.g., borders, separators, quote bars, table header backgrounds, and little bits of whimsy. Tables are `Gray Cloud` with `Snow` for the alternate rows, and code blocks are `c0deff`.

The site supports the setting a variable in the local browser storage to remember themes, it's a challenge for the visitor to find the toggle.

The site uses some icons to denote the type of content, these are: &rarr; (`&rarr;`) for posts that link to other sites, &raquo; (`&raquo;`) for quotations, and &#11084; (`&#11084;`) for external links, although ultimately these are all just decorative and non-functional.

## In The Press

During an era of running a successful and pioneering football analytics website I had work published on the Chelsea FC website, [FourFourTwo](https://thechels.uk/fourfourtwo-cult-heroes) [magazine](https://thechels.uk/fourfourtwo-chelsea-vs-swansea), [Man City's match day programme](https://thechels.uk/man-city-programme), the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2282976/Frank-Lampard-scores-200th-Chelsea-goal.html), the [Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/valencia-penalty-gary-neville-chelsea-under19s-uefa-youth-league-a6892926.html) and various club fan sites including [Crystal Palace](https://theeaglesbeak.com/2014/08/08/view-from-the-opposition-part-1/), [Walsall](https://walsall.vitalfootball.co.uk/chelsea-a-fans-view/), Swansea and Man City.

The associated [Twitter](/images/ChelseaStats.png) [account](https://web.archive.org/web/20160330035832/https://twitter.com/ChelseaStats), active from 2010 to 2018, peaked at 185,000 followers with a monthly reach of 8 million users worldwide all through organic growth and received acclaim from Opta Sports, Chelsea FC, BBC and other organisations. The account was ranked 4th most influential Chelsea twitter account by HITC in 2013. The account was closed due to Twiiter's ownership change, whilst also noting football statistics had become more mainstream and access to data had become less readily available given it's commerical importance to data businesses and it's adoption by clubs targeting performance gains.
