- [Cheltenham Open Data](https://cod.thechels.uk) - A GitHub project to collect and disseminate public open data from a variety of sources, created during the covid pandemic and lockdown 2020. The project pulls together terrorism ratings, food-bank data, flood warnings and covid data (now archived). The page now includes helpful phone numbers, consolidated local news and more being added as it becomes available. The main requirement was to just republish existing data as RSS feeds (xml) as it continues to be an undervalued publishing format.

- [Boinc](https://boinc.thechels.uk) - Hosting a web page for a friend; BOINC is a platform that allows computers all round the world to contribute their spare computing capacity to run distributed applications. Several of those involved with TheChels.org contribute their computers in such a way. Distributed applications are largely run by Universities to research fields such as Biology & Medicine, Earth Sciences, Mathematics or Physics & Astronomy.

- [SecOpsNews](https://github.com/SecOpsNews/news) - RSS items as GitHub Issues for the discerning engineering leader or security professional. A repository to track and publish third party (RSS) feeds from various security sites as GitHub issues. Note this is quite noisy but seems well liked with over 50 stars on GitHub

- [Feeds](https://feeds.thechels.uk/) - An RSS feed aggregator that combines a bunch of RSS feeds into discrete pages per topic and all into one place and one simple view aimed at the discerning insurance technology professional.

- [Tools](https://tools.thechels.uk) - A digital playground or smorgasbord of ad-hoc and occasional tooling, including converting file types, charting, and string manipulations.
