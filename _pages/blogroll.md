This is a subset of my OPML focused on indie web, tech focused publications, and businesses publishing reliable and useful information. 

Data is processed and updated monthly.  

Not all feeds are shown to maintain some OPSEC and to keep noise to a minimum e.g., main stream news, local news, weather, and public data sources. I also use RSS to follow Reddit subs, newsletters, and status pages for services or businesses.
