This is a subset of my OPML file from my RSS reader,  focused on the indie web, tech focused publications, and businesses publishing reliable and useful information. 

Data is processed and updated automatically on a monthly basis.  

Not all feeds are shown to maintain some OPSEC and to keep noise to a minimum e.g., main stream news, local news, weather, and public data sources. I also use feeds to follow Reddit subs, newsletters, and status pages for relevant services or businesses.
