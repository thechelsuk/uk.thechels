seo: Statement on AI

---

Due to my [disability](/disability) I have become more reliant on AI to help support me in maintaining my online presence and this website, my public second brain.

## Statement of use

I use AI to help write code, often very simple logic in python, liquid or ruby, as well as HTML, CSS, and JS. I review and test all code generated and hand write my code where I am able, although this is diminishing. I seem able to read code and determine it's quality much more easily but my cognitive dysfunction makes writing code much harder.

I use AI for spell-checking, wording, grammar, and as a peer review for the words I write and share.

I don't use AI to formulate opinions or to generate content (typically referred to as AI Slop).

I use automations to help simplify my content generation using Shortcuts, Drafts Actions and text replacement/keys as well as GitHub actions extensively.

I am comfortable with this stance as none of my apps, plug-ins, websites nor code collection, store, or use personal data of users/visitors.
