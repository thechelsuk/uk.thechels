seo: Statement on AI

---

Due to my [disability](/disability) I have become more reliant on AI to help support me in maintaining my online presence and this website, my public second brain.

## Statement of use

I use AI to help write code, often very simple logic in python, liquid or ruby, as well as HTML, CSS, and JS. I review and test all code generated and hand write my code where I am able, although this is diminishing. I seem able to read code and determine it's quality much more easily but my cognitive dysfunction makes writing code much harder.

I use AI for spell-checking, wording, grammar, and as a peer review for the words I write and share.

I do _not_ use AI to formulate opinions or to generate content (typically referred to as AI Slop).

### Automation

Although not AI, I use comprehensive tools and automations to help complete everyday technology tasks.

I use automations to help simplify my content generation using Shortcuts, Drafts Actions and text replacement/keys as well as GitHub actions extensively. 


## Summary

I am comfortable with my AI stance. It is a useful tool given my situation. whilst protecting consulers and users as none of my apps, plug-ins, websites nor code produced collect, store, or use personal data of users/visitors.

bottom line is none of my or my users private or personal data is shared.
