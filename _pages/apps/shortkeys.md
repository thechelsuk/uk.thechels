ShortKeys is a productivity app for people who live in text. Build multi-line snippets, drop them behind memorable keyboard shortkeys, and fly through forms, support replies, or daily journaling.

## Highlights

- Custom iOS keyboard brings text expansion to any app with haptics, keyboard sounds, double-space periods, and hold-to-repeat backspace.
- Optional hotkey button keeps your most-used punctuation a tap away - often used as a prefix.
- Free plan covers 10 shortkeys, the tip jar unlocks 5 more, and the annual subscription removes all limits for heavy users.
- Organise shortkeys with tags, pinned collections, and search, and sync everything through iCloud.
- Deep-link and URL scheme support means ShortKeys slots into Shortcuts automations; JSON backup/restore keeps libraries portable for those who want a personal export.
- Enable iCloud sync to keep up to date across iPhone and iPad.
- Appearance controls reflect Light, Dark, or System themes and custom tint colours to match your style.
- [App Privacy Policy](/app/privacy).
