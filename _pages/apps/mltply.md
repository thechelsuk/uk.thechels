Mltply uses a friendly chat-style interface to make maths practice less intimidating. Short prompts keep the pace up, and repetition cements knowledge while keeping things playful.

## Highlights

- Chat-style interface starring Buddy, a friendly maths robot who keeps practice conversational.
- Configure numbers 1–12, pick operations, and toggle sequential or random order for tailored drills.
- Instant feedback and streak tracking encourage kids to keep going while keeping progress entirely on-device.
- Unlock achievements and celebrate milestones to keep motivation high based on each number, operation, and overall progress.
- No in-app purchases, subscriptions, or data sharing; the code is open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/mat-0/Mltply) for added transparency.
- Built with SwiftUI for a fun, lightweight experience that fits quick study sessions.
- [App Privacy Policy](/app/privacy).
