seo: my disabilities are ME/CFS and MCAS

---

I suffer from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis commonly known as ME or ME/CFS, and MCAS. 

Additionally I Protanopia and Deuteranopia (colorblindness) and Raynaud's syndrome.

I am largely homebound and unable to work, physical activity is severly limited as well as cognitive exertion and stress excerbate symptoms.

I am sensitive to light and sound most of the time and suffer from a wide range of symptoms including palpatations, stabbing pains, neurological and nerve pain, overwhelming sense of feeling poisioned.

_Imagine the worst flu you've ever had and imagine that feeling for everyday of the rest of our life and that is what your new baseline or new normal is._

## ME

ME is a complex and chronic medical condition that effects multiple body systems.

It most often develops after an acute viral or bacterial infection from which people seem unable to fully recover. 

_Many Long Covid suffers meet the diagnostic criteria for ME_

It can cause many different symptoms, which can be triggered or worsened by any kind of effort or activity.

### Symptoms

Symptoms vary by invdividual, can change over time, and can vary in severity making management incredibly difficult.

The 4 key symptoms are:

- Post-exertional Malaise (known as PEM) in which symptoms can worsen and excerbate after mental or physical activity, this can be immediate onset or can be delayed, typically around 24-48 hours.
- Sleep disturbance and unfreshing sleep; This can be insomnia, hypersomnia, feeling unrefreshed, stiffness on waking. Increasing time asleep does not improve symptoms.
- Overwhelming fatigue - including flu-like malaise, chronic pain, headaches, nausea, digestive problems, and sensitivity to light, sound and other stimuli.
- Cognitive disturbance; commonly known as brain fog, whereby finding the right words, or remembering, or understanding is impared.

### Treatment

ME/CFS has no effective drug treatment and full recovery is rare. It is criminally under-researched, understood and diagnosis and medical support is difficult due to a history of misleading and poor quality studies by face-saving psychologists who still perceive ME as a paychological or hysteria issue.

Modern research has shown a physical and multi-system disease and more research is beginning go take place.

### Diagnosis and co-morbidities

Symptoms overlap with many other treatable illnesses so seek support from health care professionals

Given the multi-system nature of the disease other issues are frequently identified such as POTs, MCAS, Dysautomnia, Fibromyalgia.

## MCAS

Mast Cell Activation Syndrome is a condition that causes intense episodes of symptoms when mast cells (mistakenly) alert the immune system that there’s something harmful in body. Similar to an allergic reaction or fighting a virus.

### Symptoms

Flushing, itching, swlling, hives, congestion, breathlessness, increase hear rate, weakness, fainting, drop in blood pressure, stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea.

### Treatment

Some see benefit from Type H1 and H2 Antihistamines.

## Diagnosis

There is a blood test, although often inconclusive and can frequently be a false negative. Instead with guidance from health care professionals, diagnosis is often confirmed retrospectively after a trial of antihistamine medication coinciding with an improvment in symptoms.
