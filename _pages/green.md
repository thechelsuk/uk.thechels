## Sustainability

- Avoid fast fashion
- Avoid unnecessary plastics (e.g, using soap and shampoo bars over bottled gels)

## Garden

- The small garden is allowed to grow in spring and we delay the first cut of the lawn to allow for pollinators to benefit.
- An area of the garden is set up for wild flowers.
- We have grown a mixture of fruit and vegetables including apples, blackberries, rhubarb, strawberries, potatoes, carrots, parsnips and radishes.

## Recycling

- Actively seek to recycle waste products. As a household we rarely fill the refuse waste, but do fill the recycling boxes for card, glass, and foil and plastics.
- We also recycle coffee pods and contact lenses and give plenty to charity as well as shop there often.

## Energy

- 10 Solar Panels and a 5kw battery helps reduce reliance on the grid. Home is 60% independent from the grid based on metrics over a rolling 12-month period.
- Energy provider uses green energy.
- 100% of the home uses smart energy efficient lighting.
- Own an EV (as a gift to my spouse) but have never been able to nor learned to drive so all commuting has been via foot or public transport.

## Travel

- Previously working was mostly from home, but occasional trips to London for work are by train. The Trainline App reports that this journey typically saves 27kg of CO₂.
- For all train travel since June 2021, I have saved 448kg of CO₂. Using 197kg compared 645kg had the journey been by car.
- Due to my [disability](/disability) I am currently homebound and not working, so travel has reduced to zero.
