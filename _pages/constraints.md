I backed a Kickstarter years ago that delivered a set of playing card sized constraint cards. Made with the premise of picking a card at random and then using the constraint to inspire a design or development solution.

These cards are a great way to get out of a creative rut or to challenge yourself to think differently about a problem. They can be used in team brainstorming sessions, solo work, or even as a warm-up exercise before starting a project.

The cards are listed below, shared only because the Kickstarter and associated website is no longer available.
