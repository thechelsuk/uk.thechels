# Site

A blog hosted on GitHub is available at TheChels.uk. The site uses Jekyll, a static site generator, on Ruby. DNS and SSL by Cloudflare. It also uses GitHub actions, GitHub issues, and Python for extensive automation.

It is called "weak notes" as a play on words of the popular "week notes" [blogging style](https://weeknot.es/) -
due to the likelihood, I will have an inconsistent and irregular cadence for posting.

## Configuration

There are several optional settings for you to configure. Use the example `_config.yml` file in the repo and use the documentation below to configure your site:

<details><summary><code>Config</code></summary>

### Using includes

  There are 2 main includes: one for the header and one for the footer, largely to minimise repetition.

### Using layouts

  Layouts are almost one-to-one with pages, handling any page specifics. `post.html` is the layout used for every blog post. There are also default templates and an empty template used for `scss` and other special pages such as `humans.txt`

### Using Data

  Data files power many aspects of the site and these are updated via issues and GitHub Actions.

### Site navigation

  Using configuration yml, navigation is provided by three collections for `header`, `footer`, and `around_the_web` (on the about page) and are fairly self-explanatory.
