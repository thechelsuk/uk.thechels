I have been evolving my website over the last few weeks - football season is over - and I am using GitHub Actions to automate my processes and essentially use GitHub's Issues as a content management system (CMS).

CMSs typically have a database backend see WordPress and MySql, there are headless CMSs like Strapi that offer up an API from datasources, but being a cheapskate and hosting my website on GitHub pages I don't have the option of a database. So using the tools at hand I am able to create an issue in GitHub using issue templates (these help structure the content and automatically applies labels).

From these I can then trigger an action that either converts an issue to a markdown file as a post or by adding some data to a yaml file - Jekyll my static site generator uses yaml files (along with CSV and JSON) as data sources.

the below action shows a check against the `labelname` to make sure the right action runs by passing the variable into another action called `runner`.

Data in yaml files can be looped over at build time to create tables, lists. Using the liquid templating language one can sort and group data too. Such that i now record podcasts, books, websites, films, football teams and a to do list all in yaml files ans all managed by GitHub's issues.

```yaml
name: Add Item
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled, edited]
jobs:
  Validation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, "labelname" )
    outputs:
      labelname: ${{ steps.validation.outputs.labelname }}
    steps:
      - name: Set Data
        id: validation
        run: echo "::set-output name=labelname::labelname"
  Execution:
    needs: Validation
    name: Runner
    uses: ./.github/workflows/runner.yml
    with:
      content: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
      label: ${{ needs.Validation.outputs.labelname }}
```
