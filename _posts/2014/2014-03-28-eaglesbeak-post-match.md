Football. Bloody hell. Palace were lucky to have 11 men when Puncheon went in at the shin of Azpilicueta early on, that was a red in my opinion, he was later involved with a foul and kicked the ball away at 1-0. Considering the 2 yellows Willian had a Villa it seems a little strange these weren't dealt with correctly by Lee Mason.

Palace were worthy winners regardless and should be disappointed not to have sorted out their goal difference for the relegation run-in. Palace were quicker, stronger and more organised than Chelsea for the entire game and the blues, in white, were left to pump cross after cross from rubbish angles playing into the hands of Speroni who was spot on when asked and in to the hands of a Tony Pulis rearguard that was well drilled. Palace were lightening on the counter attack and should have killed the game of earlier. Three, four or five goals would not have flattered the team.

I predicted this sort of result for Palace back in December [https://theeaglesbeak.com/2013/12/view-bridge/] when Palace came to the bridge, but was hopeful it wouldn’t be against us.

See you next season.
