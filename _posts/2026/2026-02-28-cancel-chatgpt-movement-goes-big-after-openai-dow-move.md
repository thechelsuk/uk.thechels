_warning; quote references two X posts_

> In a [post on X](https://x.com/sama/status/2027578652477821175?s=20), Altman claimed that OpenAI's models would not be used for mass surveillance, but that claim was immediately [contradicted](https://x.com/sama/status/2027578652477821175?s=20) by a U.S. government official, who said that OpenAI's models would be used for "all lawful means." Mass surveillance of American citizens is lawful in "some scenarios" as part of the post-9/11 U.S. Patriot Act, which permits mass harvesting of communications meta data, even if some aspects of it have been curtailed in recent years.
