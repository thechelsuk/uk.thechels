Reddit has some communities I am interested in due to my current situation (medical, financial etc) but 15% seems low for AI slop posts.

> The data backs this up. 54% of LinkedIn posts are now likely AI-written ([Originality.ai](https://originality.ai/blog/linkedin-ai-study-engagement)). 15% of Reddit posts too, up 146% since 2021. Every competitor has the same capability to generate keyword-optimized, structurally correct, grammatically polished content. In about twelve seconds.
