Slowly, then quickly. 

Clear onset of not feeling right like a two-week virus. Slow ongoing persistent decline (like inverse stock market; volatility, but long term downward trend). Cutting back on everything then very very quickly into a huge reduction in capacity forcing me to stop work.

My baseline is housebound, mostly at rest physically, mild cognitive load, but during PEM/Crashes a solitary space and absolute non-sensory environment e.g., no sound and complete darkness is required.

Comprehension and retention are compromised. Reasoning, memory affected. Frustration in finding the right words or memories is a problem.
