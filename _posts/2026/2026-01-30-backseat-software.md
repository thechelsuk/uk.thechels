> What if your car worked like so many apps? You're driving somewhere important…maybe running a little bit late. A few minutes into the drive, your car pulls over to the side of the road and asks:

>  _"How are you enjoying your drive so far?"_

> Annoyed by the interruption, and even more behind schedule, you dismiss the prompt and merge back into traffic.

> A minute later it does it again.

> _"Did you know I have a new feature? Tap here to learn more."_
