Cybaa to the rescue

> In April 2025, Probely announced that the Security Headers API will discontinued in April 2026. As far as we know, the free website service will remain available for the foreseeable future.

> If you were using it for anything below, you now need an alternative:
> - CI/CD checks
> - Automated estate scanning 
> - Compliance evidence 
> - Repeated audits without manual effort

> That's why I am really excited to announce that alongside our existing services, we've released an endpoint to serve as a replacement for the Security Headers API.
