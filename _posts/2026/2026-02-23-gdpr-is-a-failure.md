> A company can list an email address as their official GDPR contact in their privacy policy, and if their own spam filter eats your request, it legally never happened. There is no obligation to check. There is no obligation to ensure delivery. The burden is entirely on you to prove they received it.
> 
> This isn't an edge case. This is a systemic loophole that allows any company to quietly discard data protection requests with zero consequences. Set up aggressive spam filtering on your GDPR inbox, and you've effectively opted out of the regulation.
