This is great, except for when the AI gets it wrong and it's on my permanent health care record.

My notes say I suffer from "hiccups and had a hangover", when describing gastrointestinal issues like heartburn and acid reflux and that ME brain fog is worse than any hangover and is a constant blur.

> New AI notetaking tools being backed by the NHS could help doctors spend up to a quarter more time with their patients.

> NHS organisations across England are being urged to take advantage of a new national registry of 19 suppliers for the technology, which captures clinician--patient conversations and uses AI to accurately generate real-time transcriptions and clinical summaries, while ensuring data protection.

> Embracing the cutting-edge tools, known as ambient voice technologies, could save clinicians up to 2 or 3 minutes for each patient consultation, freeing up more time for them to see other patients.
