> Wolves striker Tolu Arokodare and Sunderland winger Romaine Mundle subjected to racist abuse on social media | Football News | Sky Sports


> Kick It Out's statement read: "We stand alongside Wesley Fofana and Hannibal Mejbri, who once again have both been targeted with vile abuse online.
> 
> "Players are standing up to discrimination and we've had record reports to Kick It Out from across football this season, but we recognise the frustration in how it continues to fester online.
> 
> "Words matter but actions are more important. Football is working together to tackle this issue alongside the UK Football Policing Unit and Ofcom, but social media companies must do more to offer protections to players and help improve accountability when incidents occur.
> 
> "Those who face this disgusting abuse must always be the priority."
