Cash for fees, money market funds? 

> An [HMRC bulletin](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tax-free-savings-newsletter-19/tax-free-savings-newsletter-19-november-2025) has today outlined the intended measures:

> - no transfers from stocks and shares and Innovative Finance ISAs to cash ISAs
> - tests to determine whether an investment is eligible to be held in a stocks and shares ISA or is 'cash like'
> - a charge on any interest paid on cash held in a stocks and shares or Innovative Finance ISA
