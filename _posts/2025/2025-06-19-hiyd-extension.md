Today I'm happy to announce that Hiyd  extension is now generally available via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hiyd/hkeklhoojnogpfmiikadpcmkmpldhpce).

The extension captures selected text on a page and via the context menu allows the use to save this as a quote and creates a markdown file with Jekyll front matter.

Save it to your Hiyd iCloud Drive folder to sync with the mobile app.

Save it to your git repo to publish to your Jekyll blog.
