> Chelsea experienced a 44% increase in injuries between June and October compared with the previous season, a report released on Tuesday has found. This year's period covers their participation in the [Club World Cup](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/13/chelsea-stun-psg-to-win-club-world-cup-after-cole-palmers-cool-double) and its aftermath.

> The figure, which goes some way towards vindicating Enzo Maresca's rotation and his complaints about injuries, is contained in a report published by the insurance company Howden, which puts the cost of injuries to clubs in Europe's top five leagues over the past five years at almost £3bn.
