AI slop is coming for your ears

> A company called Inception Point AI is flooding podcast directories with content. In general I don't have a position on what Castro users choose to listen to in their podcast apps and would like to help them find content they're looking for even if it is badly produced or unlistenable. But this company seems to be keying on popular searches in order to flood search results and deceive users.
