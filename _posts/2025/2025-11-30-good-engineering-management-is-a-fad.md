> Having been and worked with engineering managers for some time, I think there are [eight foundational engineering management skills](/categories-engineering-leadership/), which I want to personally group into two clusters: core skills that are essential to operate in all roles (including entry-level management roles), and growth skills whose presence--or absence--determines how far you can go in your career.

> The core skills are:

> 1. **Execution**: lead team to deliver expected tangible and intangible work. Fundamentally, management is about getting things done, and you'll neither get an opportunity to begin managing, nor stay long as a manager, if your teams don't execute.

> _Examples_: ship projects, manage on-call rotation, sprint planning, manage incidents

> 2. **Team**: shape the team and the environment such that they succeed. This is _not_ working for the team, nor is it working for your leadership, it is finding the balance between the two that works for both.

> _Examples_: hiring, coaching, performance management, advocate with your management

> 3. **Ownership**: navigate reality to make consistent progress, even when reality is difficult Finding a way to get things done, rather than finding a way that it not getting done is someone else's fault.

> _Examples_: doing hard things, showing up when it's uncomfortable, being accountable despite systemic issues

> 4. **Alignment**: build shared understanding across leadership, stakeholders, your team, and the problem space. Finding a realistic plan that meets the moment, without surprising or being surprised by those around you.

> _Examples_: document and share top problems, and updates during crises
