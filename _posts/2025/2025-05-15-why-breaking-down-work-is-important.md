> This is a write-up of a talk I did for our tech team at work.
>
> As developers, our bread and butter is to get our software from its current state to some future state.
> Working sustainably in small batches and performing regular releases is considered [industry best practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps_Research_and_Assessment#DORA_Four_Key_Metrics).
> It reduces the risk of errors being introduced, makes delivery of work more predictable, and enables us to learn faster.
>
> But why is this the case, and how might we do that? First, a definition.

...

> The team’s the thing
> “Be ruthless with systems, be kind with people” - Michael Brooks
>
> Delivering high-quality software is a team sport, and we need to support each other. We should be aspiring to set up our workplace such that psychological safety and non-violent communication are first-class concerns rather than nice-to-haves.
>
> Work together, challenge the systems that make doing that hard, build an environment where good software is a natural outcome rather than a goal.
>
> tl;dr
>
> - Identify where the value is.
> - Do those things first.
> - Optimise your delivery for fast feedback.
> - Challenge things that hinder you.
