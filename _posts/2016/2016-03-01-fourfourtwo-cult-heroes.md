Chelsea: Gianfranco Zola (Striker, 1996-2003) (@ChelseaStats)

“It’s almost unheard of these days that a Chelsea player would be universally liked but his attitude and infectious smile made Zola special"

“Chelsea were nothing special back in 1996, but were at the beginning of a glorious 20-year period. Zola, a £4.5m signing of Ruud Gullit’s, was immediately involved en route to winning the FA Cup for the first time in 26 years. “He was voted FWA Player of the Year despite having only joined in November, and went on to score the winning goal in the European Cup Winners’ Cup final against Stuttgart in 1998. Tying Julian Dicks up in knots was another personal highlight.

“Simply, he gave us unprecedented quality. It’s almost unheard of these days that a Chelsea player would be universally liked but his attitude and infectious smile made Zola special and different to most modern day footballers.” Favourite moment: “Turning Jamie Carragher inside out and leaving him on his backside, beating another two Liverpool players in the process.”
